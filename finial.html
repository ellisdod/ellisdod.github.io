              <p>Our approach is information rich and modular in design and construction, utilising repeatable components and details, and parametricising non-standard parts. We are inherently sustainable, increasing urbanity with its associated lower resource footprint, optimising existing built assets with their sunk carbon, choosing a low embodied carbon and low polutant materials, dynamic carbon modelling and designing for disassembly. Stage 2 sustainability includes exploration of re-use and harvested materials, designing for change based upon typology and material characteristics, and partnership with sustainable material resources. We are committed to the design and development of high-quality spaces.</p>
